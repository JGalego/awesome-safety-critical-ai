## Key Considerations 🗝️

When proposing a new reference or section, please keep the following in mind:

**General**
* This list is meant to highlight notable references and tools, not to be an exhaustive directory.
* Ensure that all contributions are listed in alphabetical order within their respective sections.
* Before adding a new section, please open an issue for discussion.

**Tools/Frameworks**
* Tools should have a minimum of 100 stars on GitHub.
* Tools should not be listed in more than one section.
* Tools should not be archived and must have been actively maintained within the last 6 months.

## Review Process 📝

**Initial Feedback:** When a pull request (PR) or issue is created, initial feedback will be provided by the maintainers.

**Decision:** A decision will be made based on the feedback. The decision might not be perfect, but it is necessary to move forward.

**Limited Discussions:** If discussions become prolonged or extend beyond a few exchanges, the proposed changes may be rejected, and the PR or issue will be closed.

🙏 **Thank you again for contributing!** If you have any questions, feel free to [open an issue](https://github.com/JGalego/awesome-safety-critical-ai/issues/new).
